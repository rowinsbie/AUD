# AUD



## Description
AUD stands for Anti Unethical Drivers, It is a platform where commuters can report abusive,reckless and rude behaviours of the PUV Drivers.

I've been a commuter ever since I had to attend college, I have experience dealing with various drivers, and there are things that I've been noticing about them. some of the drivers are rude, reckless or abusive.

I built this project to modernize and improve the reporting system against these type of PUV Drivers, and to make sure that they'll be held accountable with their actions.

The AUD will enable the commuters to file complaints against these unethical drivers.
The complaints will be received by the drivers association officials, and if they had failed to act on it, the system will escalate the complaints to the LGU and the failure of the officials to act with the complaints will be posted publicly.
